Currently, the Blood Bank supplies around 1000 units of blood per month. It also operates a transfusion service, providing blood for cardiac surgeries and therapy. The bank’s activities include storing, processing and banking blood.
                
                The Blood Bank conducts post donation screening tests, Rh titre, Coombs test cold and warm antibodies, blood grouping and typing as well as haemoglobin tests for blood donors. Cross-matching tests are done by automated gel technology.</p>
